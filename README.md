# Project: Chat and Music Streaming Application

This project aims to build a chat and music streaming application that operates on two network models: Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The application utilizes the Java programming language and communication protocols UDP and TCP to ensure performance and reliability in data transmission. It allows users to exchange text messages in real-time and provides online music streaming services.

## Project Objectives

- Develop an application that integrates both chat and music streaming functionalities.
- Implement the Client-Server model to coordinate users into rooms, and the P2P model for clients to communicate with each other.
- Use the UDP protocol for sending text messages.
- Use the TCP protocol for transmitting audio data.
